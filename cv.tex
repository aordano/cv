\section{About Me}

 { \flushleft I'm a \textbf{self-taught} software developer with \textbf{3 years} of formal experience, having worked mainly in \textbf{Full Stack} Web development, along some Sysadmin and DevOps work, with a focus on small organizations. I mainly use \textbf{TypeScript} and a bit of \textbf{Rust}, but can handle different languages and frameworks, as the breadth of my experience forced me to be quick to adapt. My non-sofware experience and education also includes Graphic Design, Engineering, UX, and business development.
